camelWriter is a solution to an Exercise that was given 
to me during one of my one of my 2. semester of courses 
in software engineering at SDU.


The requirement for the assignment was:

The first char in the first word in a line had to be lower case

The following word in the line the first char had to be upper case

The words had to be put together without any spaces in between


camelWriter is a program that converts txt files line by line 
to lowerCamel Case also known as mixed camel case. 
for camelWriter to work the txt file has to be the project folder 
i have included some examples of 3 songs which i got for the exercise


this means that if you have a String like:

"Hello my name is lucas"

it would convert it to 

"helloMyNameIsLucas"


once the entire file has been converted, a new file will be
made in the folder with the containing the changes called 
camelWrite.txt
